GOLD GETTER

I wrote most of this code in a span of about 5-8 hours before this project was
originally due. I also had only been programming for a few months at that
point so don't judge me too harshly haha. I didn't understand what objects
were. -- 2022 Stephen

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a hack of an old project I made to add pygame for display. I used heavily
from this tutorial:
https://thecodezine.com/a-simple-python-tic-tac-toe-game-using-pygame/
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Original README:
This is a game that I made for a class project. I've been adding things to it when 
I get bored.

It's really poorly written.

Run it in a terminal with:
	python3 gold-getter.py
Or run it in an IDE.

Objective:
Get the gold before a bomb gets you!

Controls:
Move the player with wasd. Player moves twice for every time that the bomb moves.

Key:
P Player
B Bomb
G Gold
, Where the bomb has been
. Where the player has been
