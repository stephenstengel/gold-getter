GOLD GETTER

This is a game that I made for a class project. I've been adding things to it when 
I get bored.

Run it in a terminal with:
	python3 gold-getter.py
Or run it in an IDE.

Objective:
Get the gold before a bomb gets you!

Controls:
Move the player with wasd. Player moves twice for every time that the bomb moves.

Key:
P Player
B Bomb
G Gold
, Where the bomb has been
. Where the player has been
